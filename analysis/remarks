Are there any flights that only occur once every two weeks?
Do we have to differentiate between the actual duration of the flight and the planned duration?
Is our decomposition of manufacturer-airplanes-airplane models too far fetched?



AANNAMES

Vluchtnummer per vlucht, onafhankelijk van het vliegtuig
Schedule-schedulItem kan mss nog worden verbeterd

TODO
----
During different times of the year, the number of ﬂights may change and the prices
will vary. For example, in peak season the number of ﬂights will increase, whereas
in low season the number of ﬂights will decrease and prices may decrease. Some
airlines do not ﬂy on religious holidays.
