* Are we populating the whole database in one go, or is the DSL used
  to incrementally add new flights to the database, making use of data
  already stored in the database? Take for instance the airports,
  cities, countries, airplane models, etc., can we assume that they
  are already present in the database, or should our DSL populate them
  too?

* Are there any flights that recur on a basis other than a weekly one,
  like for instance once every two weeks, only on December 24th, or
  every second Thursday of the month, etc.?

* Should we store the airplane model manufacturers too?

During different times of the year, the number of flights may change
and the prices will vary. For example, in peak season the number of
flights will increase, whereas in low season the number of flights
will decrease and prices may decrease. Some airlines do not fly on
religious holidays.
